# PDF Cheat Sheet(s)

This repository contains cheat sheets about the Portable Document Format.
There is currently only one sheet, about PDF graphic operators, but there could be more in the future.

## Formats

Each sheet is obviously distributed in PDF, but also in other formats: LaTeX source code and PNG.
Before opening the PDF version, you can check it with [Caradoc](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/caradoc), using the following command.

```
$ caradoc stats --strict <sheet>.clean.pdf
```
